Welcome to my end-to-end data analytics project! This repository showcases a complete data analysis workflow using Python and SQL, focused on retail order data. It highlights my ability to handle real-world datasets, clean and preprocess data, and derive actionable insights, making it a perfect fit for data analyst positions.


Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to work with large datasets, from extraction and cleaning to analysis and visualization.
Here's a high-level overview:
1.Data Extraction: Leveraged the Kaggle API to download datasets programmatically.

2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Used Python and Pandas to handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for analysis.

3.Database Integration: Loaded the cleaned data into an SQL Server database for querying and analysis.

4.Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and derived insights using SQL queries.
